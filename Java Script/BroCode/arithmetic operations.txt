
==> arithmetic expression is a combination of,

    operands (values, variables)
    operators (+ - * / %)

==> they can be evaluated to a value

==> instead of writing, a = a+1, we can just write a+=1; 
    this is known as the augmented assignment operator

==> there is a precedence rule here,

    i. parenthesis
    ii. exponents
    iii. multiplication and division
    iv. addition and subtraction
