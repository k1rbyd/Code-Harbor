HTML:
	-> Its case-insensitive.
	-> But we do have to be careful with the html tags
	-> We can display documents on all platforms alike

	-> Its gonna make website creating easy, and this is always linked with css
	-> In short, HTML makes the interent better

	-> We can use F12 to inspect any web pages
	
Tags:
	-> A tag is a keyword or a term assinged to a peice of information.
	-> There are 2 main tags, opening and closing tag
	-> <a> is opening and </a> is closing
	->    <a    	           href  =   "contact.html">     Contact us		 </a>
	->opening, attribute name , attribute value , 	content	, 	closing tag

	-> In the <head> tag, we will add <meta> tags, these will tell us how they will act on google.


	-> We always need to start off with an index.html, as the webpages will look for this one first.

Heading:
	-> These tags are basically used to give heading to any content on the page
	-> There are in total 6 headers
	-> Headings 1-6
	->h1 will have the highest and the h2 and then h3
	-> <h1> hello </h1>
              <h2> hello </h2>
      	      <h3> hello </h3>
	   <h4> hello </h4>
		here, h1 will be the biggest font and the least will be h3

Quotation:
	-> <b> : bold text
	-> <strong> : important text
	-> <i> : italic text
	-> <em> : emphasized text
	-> <mark> : marked text
	-> <small> : smaller text
	-> <del> : deleted text
	-> <ins> : inserted text
	-> <sub> : subscripted text 
	-> <sup>: superscript text
	
	-> bold and important texts are almost the same
	-> italics and emphasized texts are almost the same
	-> mark tag will highlight the data
	-> small tag will make the font smaller
	-> del tag gives out a striked out data thingy
	-> insert tag will give the text underlined

-> To comment we must click on ctrl+/

Attributes:
	-> All the elements have attributes
	-> They simply provide additional info abt the elements
	-> They are always specified in the start tag
	-> They mostly are used for width, height and colour
	-> Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like name = "Value"

-> <font> tag gives the colour to your text in HTML.
-> example:	<font color = 'blue'><b> helloo </b></font> 

-> to change the background colour, we have to go to the body tag and type,
<body bgcolor = 'blue'>


Anchor:
	-> These link one website to another.
	-> The blue links we see online are hyperlinks

Creating an anchor:- 
{inside the body tag}
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube.com</a>

for it to open up in a new tab
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="__blank">Youtube.com</a>

Image:
	-> we will use the <img> tag
	-> IMAGE TAGS HAVE NO CLOSING TAGS
	-> example:
	
	<img src ="location" alt="this is the image" />
	
	-> we should double check the image location
	-> for adjusting the width and height, all we got to do is include the attributes height and width
	-> example:
	
	<img src ="location" alt="this is the image"  height = "600" width = "400"/>

Paragraph:
	-> its <p> and </p>
	-> it prints out paras
	-> basically, it gives out a new line gap between 2 printed lines

Break:
	-> <br /> alone
	-> It splits a sentence after where its present and displays it in the next line

Table:
	-> We make tables with the uage of table tag
	-> <table> is used to make a table
	-> we can use border attribute in table tag and give the border details
	-> <tr> tag is used to specify table rows
	-> <th> tag is used to specify table headings
	-> <td> tag is used to give in data
	-> we can chage the width too, we just have to add an attribute width in the table tag
	-> we can also change the alignment , we just have to add an attribute align in the table tag
	-> we can chang the table colour as well, we just have to add in an attribute bgcolor in the table tag

List:
	-> List tags are used to display the data present in the form of lists
	-> They are of 3 types 	<ul>	defines an unordered list
				<ol>	defines an ordered list
				<li>	defines a list item
	-> The unordered list will just use bullet points and will print out the data whereas the ordered list will print out the data along with the number
	->  we can use the numbering as letters both uppercase and lowercase and also roman numerals to list the items of an ordered list,
	-> example:
		<ol type=["i" for roman numerals] ["I" for roman numerals] ["A" for caps] ["a" for lowercase]>
		<li>One</li>
		<li>Two</li>
		<li>Three</li>
		</ol>

Videos:
	-> The HTML video tag is just to embed a video on the webpage
	-> example:
		<video width="300" height="400" controls>
		<source src = "location" type="video/mp4" />
		</video>
	-> There is also a shortcut method, all we have to do is
		<video src="location" width="size" height="size" controls></video>
	-> To use a youtube video, we just need to put the link in the src
	-> example:
		    <video width = "1000" height="600" controls muted>
        			<source src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ/" type="WebM" />
    		</video>

Audio: 
	-> For audio tag, all we need to use is
	<audio src="location" controls>
	</audio>

Form tags:
	-> these are the tags which are used for user input
	-> there are multiple input types, example
		<input type = "text">				this gives out a text box for us to reply with
		<input type = "radio">				this gives out a single correct mcq kinda circle			
		<input type = "checkbox">				this gives a box where we can tick			
		<input type = "submit">				this displays the submit button 

	-> to form a form page, we need to use the <form></form> tags
	-> a basic example
		<form action="">
		    <label for="fname"> first name:</label><br>	
		<input type = "text" id = "fname" name="fname" value="Enter first name"><br>
		<label for="lname">last name:</label><br>	
		<input type = "text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Enter last name"><br>
		<input type="submit" value="Submit">
		</form>
	-> here, the id attribute has no meaning, its only useful in CSS

Input:
	-> These tags can be used in form tags and also not in form tags.
	-> there are a lot of input types
	-> <input type=" ">
	-> There are,
	text,		range,		reset,		url,
	password,	file,		search,		week
	email,		hidden,		submit,
	radio,		image,		tel,
	date,		month,		button,
	datelocal-time,	number,		time,

-> Radio tag implementation:
	
	<label for=""> Gender</label>
	<input type="radio" name="gender" id="male" />
	<label for="male">Male</label>
	<input type="radio" name="gender" id="female" />
	<label for="female">Female</label>
	
-> Checkbox tag implementation:

	<label for=""> Hobbies</label><br>
	<input type="checkbox" name="hobbies" id="cricket" /></br>
	<label for="cricket">Cricket</label>
	<input type="checkbox" name="hobbies" id="baseball" /></br>
	<label for="baseball">Baseball</label>
	
-> Date tag implementation:
		
	<label for="">Date of Birth</label>
	 <input type="date" name="" id="" /></br>
	<label for="">date and time</label>
	<input type="datelocal-time" name="" id="" />
....

Basically all the other input types are kinda the same.

-> Input tags:
	{all these are typed in the <input type.... />}
	-> there are some specific attributes too, read-only and disabled
	-> disabled makes it unclickable
	-> we also got size, this is only the length of the input box
	-> we can also limit the input, by using minlength and maxlength
	-> multiple, its an attribute that specifies that the user is allowed to enter more than one value in an input field
	-> placeholder , tells us abt the pattern
	ex:
	<input 
	 type="tel"
	 id="phone"
	 name="phone"
	 placeholder="123-45-678"
	 pattern="[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{3}"
	/>

	-> we also have a "required" attribute, this unless filled wont allow the user to click on submit

-> Block elements are those present vertically, like Paragraph [these create a new line in the html on their own]
-> Whereas those elements which are present horizontally are called inline elements , like <b> <i>

Elements:
	-> to create a button, all we need to type is,
			<button>Click Here</button>
	-> to make an arrow drop option list
			<select name="" id="">
				<option value="">country</option>
				<option value="">name</option>
				<option value="">sex</option>
	-> to draw a line for seperation and stuff, we use "<hr/>"
