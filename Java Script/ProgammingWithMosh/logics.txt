==> there are 2 places where we can add script to our code

==> one if right in head or in body section

==> the best practise is, to put it at the end of the body section

==> we can just use <script></script>

==> but its more better if we seperate these 2 apart

==> we can just save the js seperately and then combine at the end


==> we can also use node js to run execute the files



==> to declare a variable in JS, 
we use, let

eg: let name;

by default, the variables values is undefined

==>we can also do this, let name = 'mine';

==> rules for naming variables, 
    i. we cant use keywords
    ii. we cant use spaces or hypens

==> if we dont want the variable to change, we can use constant

    const age = 5;
        we cant change age whereas we can change variables


==> we can also create objects

    let name = 'kaushik';
    let age = 10;

    let person = 
    {
        name : 'kaushik',
        age : 10
    };

==> we can replace the name by using,

    person.name = 'noppeee';
    person['name'] = 'no';


==> we can display it out by using ,
    console.log(person.name);


==> we can also make arrays,

    let color = ['blue', 'red', 'yellow'];

==> we can add in elements too, color[4] = 'black';

    console.log(color);

=========================

Functions

==> to declare a function, we use

    function greet()
    {
        console.log('hello world');
    }

==> theres no need for any semicolon while we create a function

==> to call it, greet();

==> we can also make it take inputs

    function greet(name)
    {
        console.log('hello ' + name);
    }

==> we can also return values from Functions

function square(num)
{
    return num*num;
}

let n1 = square(4);
console.log(n1);
