==> for staters, Arrays are limited in size. a better form of them is ArrayList.

==> ArrayList is a type of collection

==> some important collection interfaces provided by java are,

        List,
        Set,
        Queue,
        Map

==> List

        cares about which position each object is in
        elements can be added in by specifying positon - where should it be added in
        if element is added without specifying position, then its added at the end

        List<String> list = List.of("Hello","Hii","Heyyaa");

        methods present : size(),isEmpty(),contains(),get(),indexOf()

        everything here in List, is immmutable, only AL, LL and vector are mutable

    ==> converting list into ArrayList

        List<String> list_AL = new ArrayList(list);

    ==> converting list into LinkedList

        List<String> list_LL = new LinkedList(list);

    ==> converting list into Vector

        List<String> list_Vector = new Vector(list);    




    ==> LISTS CAN HAVE DUPLICATES AND SO CAN AL, LL and VECTORS

    ==> for traversing, we can use for loops, the standard one as well as the enhanced one
            ==> yet, there is another method,

        List<String> words = List.of("Apple","Ball","Cat");

        Iterator wordsIterator = words.iterator();

        while(wordsIterator.hasNext())
        {
            Sytem.out.println(wordsIterator.next())
        }


==> for sorting we can use,

    List<Integer> list = List.of(1,2,3,4,7,6,5);
    Collections.sort(list);

    ==> inorder to sort custom made lists of list, then we have to make them, 

    public class Test implements Comparable <Test>
    {
        . . . . . . . 
    }

    now this, will work,        ==> something.sort();   // this will only work now

    ==> we can also override the comparator too
