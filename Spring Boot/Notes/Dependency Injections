==> at the core, spring framework is an dependency injection

INTRO TO BEANS:
----------------

==> Beans are just a reference to the word "Concrete Classes"

==> Its just a normal implementation and creation of methods and classes





==> we can also use the @Component, if we want to skip something and just move on

==> it works just as same as @Bean

==> @Component has tons of friends, one such person is @Service

==> @Service, makes sure it runs and it makes it happen


==================

Component Scanning:
-------------------

==> before we start the appilication, Spring will look for beans and its going to look where the beans are needed

==> this will create an instance of a class and it will place it as a bean into our spring application context

==> this will look where there are needed and will place the proper methods there

==> this placing and stuff, is called dependecy injection
