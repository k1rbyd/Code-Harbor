
==> changing the dataype of a value to another 

eg:
    let age = window.prompt("How old are you");
    age = Number(age);              
                            we can also use, String(), Boolean()

    age += 1;

    console.log("You are", age, "years old.");

==> when we try doing something like this,

    let x = "apple";

    x = Number("apple");    this now contains NaN  {Not a Number}
