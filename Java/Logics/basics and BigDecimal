to find the size of any member, 
    ==> eg:
                Byte.SIZE

we can also , use the commands

eg:                                                       ALL
    Byte.BYTES                                       THESE TO BE 
    Byte.MAX_VALUE                                  TYPED IN JSHELL
    Byte.MIN_VALUE

    Short.BYTES
    Integer.MAX_VALUE

==> all these will work perfectly


converions

==> explicit and implicit

always possible to convert higher to lower, but inverse is hard and sometimes not impossible;

==> increment types,
    post and pre

{ same for decrement as well }


==> float and double arent that accurate when operations are done, to prevent their usage, we got
                            BIG DECIMALS

eg:

BigDecimal n1 = new BigDecimal("xxx.y");
BigDecimal n2 = new BigDecimal("zzz.xx");

to add them , we gotta use

n1.add(n2);

to assign, 

BigDecimal n3 = n1.add(n2);

==> BIG DECIMALS are immutable

==> for all the characters in JAVA, there is some table called unicode
eg:
    ==>  char c = '\u00A2';

if char ch = 'A';
then ch++, will give
        ==> 'B'
