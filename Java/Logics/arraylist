==> its very hard to insert and delete data from an array
        ==> we have to make a new array and then copy and paste

WE HAVE TO IMPORT ARRAY LIST FIRST          ==> import.java.util.ArrayList

==> to make this simple, java has something called arraylist

declaration:

        ==>  ArrayList arr = new ArrayList();

            arr.add("hii");
            arr.add("hello");
            arr.add(1);
            arr.add(true);

            arr.remove("hii");           we can also, remove with index  arr.remove(2);

        {this one can contain all data types, and this is never recommended}

        eg,
                ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>();
                { here we can add only integers}

                ArrayList<String> arr = new ArrayList<String>();
                { here we can add only strings}

to find the length of ArrayList, we have to use         .size()
to get the min, max we can just use                 Collections.max(arr);   arr is an
                                                    Collections.min(arr);   ArrayList
