
==> in JS, Math is an intrinsic object that provides basic mathematical funcionality and variables/constants

==> to create an instance

    let x = 3.69;

    x = Math.round(x);  // here, it will be 4
    x = Math.floor(x);  // here it will be 3
    x = Math.ceil(x);  // here it will be 4
    x = Math.pow(x,2);  // square here
    x = Math.pow(x,3);  // cube here

    let a = 1;
    let b = 2;
    let c = 3;

    maximum = Math.max(a,b,c);
    console.log(maximum);

    minimum = Math.min(a,b,c);
    console.log(minimum);

==> there is also a PI method present,

    let x = Math.PI;
    

==> we can get a random number,

    let x = Math.random();

    ==> this usually gives out a number between 0 and 1

==> suppose we want a number between 1 to 6

    let x = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);

    ==>this only gives from 0 to 5, so we gotta do
    let x = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) +1;
