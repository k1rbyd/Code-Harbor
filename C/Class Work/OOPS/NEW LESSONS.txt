/*
instead of comparing using 2 or 3 if statements, we can just use

int a,b,c;
scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
c=(a<b)?a:b;
printf("%d is the greatest",c);
return 0;

these are called terinary operators.

to access the global value, we must use the term extern, look into variable file for further application

to print the address of a variable

int i=3;
printf("%u", &i);

but, 

printf("%u", *(&i));     // this will print the value of the variable i, same as ("%d",i)
