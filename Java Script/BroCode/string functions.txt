
==> theres a method for finding the length, 
    let username = "heeeee";
    console.log(username.length);
    
==> we can get elements based on their index numbers 
    let first letter = username.charAt(0);      // this is for the first index numbers

==> we can also find specific occurances of elements

    console.log(username.indexOf("o"));
    console.log(username.lastIndexOf("o"));

==> there is also a toUpperCase() and a toLowerCase()

==> we can also replace stuff

    let phNo = "111-222-333";
    phNo = phNo.replace("-","");

==> there is also string slicing

==> slice() : extracts a section of the string and returns it as a new string, without modifying the original string


    let name = "kaushik d";
    let firstName;
    let lastName;

    firstName = name.slice(0,7);
    lastName = name.slice(4);

    // but here is a better method

    firstName = name.slice(0,indexOf(" "));
    lastName = name.slice(indexOf(" ")+1);
