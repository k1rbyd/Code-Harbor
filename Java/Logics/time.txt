we have to first import time,

==> import java.time.*

commands,
    
    LocalDate today = LocalDate.now()

    ==> today,getYear();
    ==> today.getDayOfWeek();
    
    ==> today.getMonth();
    ==> today.getMonthValue();

    ==> today.isLeapYear();
    ==> today.lengthOfYear();
    ==> today.lengthOfMonth();

    ==> today.plusDays(100);
    ==> today.plusMonths(100);
    ==> today.plusYears(100);

    ==> today.minusDays(100);
    ==> today.minusMonths(100);
    ==> today.minusYears(100);

    we can also do stuff like

    LocalDate HundredYearsBefore = today.minusYears(100);
    LocalDate HundredYearsAfter = today.plusYears(100);

==> BUT TODAY WILL ALWAYS STAY TODAY, IMMUTABLE once again

{ LocalDateTime, is the same as LocalDate, but we can go a bit more micro in this option}

we can also, 

    ==> today.withYear(2020);
    ==> today.withDay(20);
    ==> today.withMonth(2);

we also have got this option, 

    LocalDate yesterday = today.minusDays(1);

    ==> today.isBefore(yesterday);          ==> false
    ==> today.isAfter(yesterday);           ==> true
