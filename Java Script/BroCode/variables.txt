
==> a variable is a container for storing data

==> a variable behaves as if it was the value that it contains

==> there are 2 steps, declaration and assignment

==> to declare a variable, we can either use let or var
    let x;
    let age = 10;

==> the default value of variables is undefined

==> there are 4 primitive types,

    number
    string
    boolean

==> we can display multiple things,

    let name = "Kaushik";
    console.log("Hello", name, "Nice to meet you");

==> here is now a complex part,

suppose in our html page, inside the body, we add in 2 para-points

    <p id = 'p1'></p>
    <p id = 'p2'></p>

now, in our JS file, we can add in

    document.getElementById('p1').innerHTML = "Hello " + name;
    document.getElementById('p2').innerHTML = "You are " + age;
