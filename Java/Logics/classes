to create a class all we have to type is,

class name
{
    ....
}

to initiate a class, we have to type

eg,

    class Planet
    {
        .....
    }

    Planet earth = new Planet()

we can add in methods to the class as well, 

    class Planet
    {
        void revolve()
        {
            System.out.println("It revolves arount the Sun");
        }
    }
